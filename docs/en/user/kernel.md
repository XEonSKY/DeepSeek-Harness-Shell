# Kernel Management

The kernel is the program that actually drives the DeepSeek Harness Web UI; its package name is `@deepseek-ai/dsh`. This page explains how to install, update, switch, and uninstall it. The related interface is under “Settings → Kernel”.

## Kernel source

| Source | Description |
|---|---|
| **Bundled** (default) | Installed by the app into the configuration directory and run with the selected Node / npm; you can install, update, and switch versions inside the app. |
| **Global** | Uses the dsh you installed on your system with `npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh`; the app does not manage its version. |

When “Global” is selected, you need to specify the **launcher path** (pick it with the file chooser).

## First-time installation

When no kernel is detected, the app pops up the **installation wizard**: choose the mirror, whether to include test builds, and the version to install, then click “Install Kernel”. The app starts dsh automatically once installation completes.

## Check and update

- Under “Settings → Kernel” you can check **Check at startup** and **Include test builds**;
- Click “Check / Update Kernel” to compare the current and latest versions;
- **When already up to date, no dialog is shown**; the result is echoed on one line below the button (including the version number resolved remotely).

## Switch / roll back versions

- Refresh the version list (affected by “Check for test builds” and the mirror);
- Select any historical version to install / switch (upgrade or rollback). The version list hides test builds by default; if only test builds exist remotely, they are shown automatically;
- Bundled kernels are stored under `kernel/<version>/`, with **multiple versions coexisting**; in “Installed versions” you can **switch** among them (changing only the active pointer, no reinstall) or delete one.

## Uninstall

Clicking “Uninstall Kernel” stops dsh first and then removes it, after which you return to the installation guide. If uninstalling fails, the app detects the reason the directory is in use (process reference, read-only, security software lock) and reports it.

::: warning When upgrading / switching / uninstalling
These operations **first safely stop all running dsh instances** (if one is running, a confirmation is shown first). On success the app restarts automatically to run the new version; on failure it tries to restore the previous running state and gives the reason.

## Network and mirrors

Version lists, update checks, and install / uninstall all go through npm. The default official source is `registry.npmjs.org`; in China you can switch to `npmmirror`.

## Difference from “app self-update”

- **Kernel update**: updates `@deepseek-ai/dsh` (via npm), managed on this page;
- **App self-update**: updates this shell app (via GitHub releases), managed on the [About page](/en/user/update).
