## Its relationship to DeepSeek Harness

This app does **not replace** DeepSeek Harness; it is its **desktop entry point + environment manager**: it starts and supervises the dsh process, embeds the interface in a native window, and can optionally manage Node, npm, and DeepSeek Harness versions on your behalf. Conversations, workspaces, sessions, and other data still belong to DeepSeek Harness itself.
